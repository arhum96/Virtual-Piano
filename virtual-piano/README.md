# Virtual Piano

This is my implemtation of a virtual piano which enables user interaction via keyboad events to produce audio events
with the keydown event corresponding to the musical note played.

The file index.html contains the content which is displayed to the user.

The directory css contains the stylesheet for the application.

The file main.js contains the JavaScript code which enables user interaction with the webpage.

Sound for the piano keys is within the audio directory.
